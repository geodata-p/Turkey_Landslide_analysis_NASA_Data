# Executive Summary
This project analyses Turkey‚Äôs landslides from the NASA Global Landslide Catalog to understand when, why, and where fatalities occur. A reproducible Python pipeline (Colab/requirements.txt) cleans the global dataset, isolates Turkey, and quantifies risk by seasonality, trigger type, and hotspot. Results show downpours as the dominant driver of risk‚Äîthey occur more often, are deadlier per event (median 3 vs. 1.5 for rainfall), and account for over twice the total fatalities (34 vs. 15). We also surface spatial contrasts: provinces like Rize and Diyarbakƒ±r show high severity (12 and 7 fatalities per event with few events), while Artvin shows higher frequency but moderate severity (~2.8 fatalities per event).



# Project Overview
This repository analyses Turkey‚Äôs landslides from the NASA Global Landslide Catalog using Python, linking triggers to fatalities, revealing seasonal patterns, and highlighting provincial hotspots. It includes reproducible notebooks, clean data pipelines, and publication-ready visuals.

# Objectives

NASA data cleaning ‚Üí filtering Turkey ‚Üí analysis ‚Üí insights

 **Clean & classify** the NASA dataset
The NASA Global Landslide Catalog was uploaded into Google Colab using pandas, column names were standardised, and  python-dateutil was applied for robust date parsing to produce a clean, analysis-ready table.
The resulting table was then filtered to isolate Turkey-specific events.

 **Analyse seasonality**
Landslide events were grouped by month using pandas and visualised with matplotlib. Total fatalities and average fatalities per event were charted by month across 2007‚Äì2016 to highlight higher-risk months.

 **Compare impact by trigger**
Using matplotlib, bar charts were created to show and compare the number of events, total fatalities, average fatalities per event and the percentage of deadly events for each landslide trigger in Turkey. Boxplots were generated with matplotlib to compare the distribution of fatalities across different landslide triggers, demonstrating variability (median, quartiles, and outliers) rather than relying solely on averages.


 **Identify spatial hotspots** 
A bubble map was created using matplotlib, where bubble size represents fatalities and color encodes landslide triggers, making spatial clusters and deadly hotspots immediately visible. At the provincial level, a dual-axis chart compares the frequency of events (bars) with their severity (average fatalities per event, line), highlighting regions that are risk-intensive due to either frequent or unusually deadly landslides.




 # Key Findings 
 
 **Seasonality:** 
 
_Seasonality of events_: Most landslides occur between July‚ÄìNovember (midsummer to autumn).

_Severity in winter_: January (mid-winter) events are deadlier per landslide compared to other months.

![Average fatalities per event vs month](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geodata-p/Turkey_Landslide_analysis_NASA_Data/main/figures/average_fatalities_per_event_vs_month.png)


 




 **Trigger impact:**  
 
_Fatality likelihood_: ~70% of both downpour- and rainfall-triggered events result in ‚â•1 fatality.

_Frequency_: Downpours occur more often ‚Äî 11 events vs 8 for rainfall.

_Average severity_: Downpours have a higher median fatalities per event ‚Äî 3.0 vs 1.5 (rainfall).

_Total impact_: Downpours caused over 2√ó the total fatalities ‚Äî 34 vs 15 (rainfall).

_Distribution (boxplot)_: Downpours show higher median (3) and higher maximum (12) fatalities per event than rainfall (1.5 median, 7 max).

_Conclusion_: The combination of higher frequency, greater per-event severity, and larger overall impact makes downpours the dominant driver of landslide risk in Turkey; rainfall is secondary but still significant.

 **Hotspots:** 
 
 _Rize_: Rare landslide events, but very severe ‚Äî about 12 fatalities per event.

_Diyarbakƒ±r_: Also rare but high severity ‚Äî around 7 fatalities per event.

_Artvin_: More frequent landslides, but lower per-event severity ‚Äî about 2.8 fatalities per event.

_Insight_: Some provinces face fewer but deadlier events, while others experience more frequent but less severe landslides.

## SQL Validation

To validate the analytical results produced in Python, the cleaned Turkish landslide dataset was exported as a CSV file and re-analysed in MySQL Workbench (v8.0.41).

- **Data source:** [`data/landslides_tr.csv`](data/landslides_tr.csv) ‚Äî Cleaned subset of NASA‚Äôs Global Landslide Catalog, filtered for Turkey (2007‚Äì2016).
- **SQL scripts:** Stored in [`SQL_Analysis/`](SQL_Analysis) ‚Äî Each `.sql` file replicates and validates one analytical step from the Python workflow (e.g., seasonality, trigger impact, spatial hotspots).
- **Goal:** Demonstrate reproducibility and cross-validation of Python analyses using structured SQL queries.
